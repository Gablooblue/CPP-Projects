#Ordered Pair
Gets a certain number of elements and returns all the possible pairs

##Warning
Honestly this exercise doesn't make that much sense. It tries to teach object-oriented programming but it's really strange about it. I'm not allowed to make methods, and I can only declare variables in the interface (And I don't get how I'm supposed to use them because there are more efficient methods to do this).
